    <p>
    In February 2019, Spectator published a <a href = "https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2019/02/21/our-coverage-has-failed-students-of-color-we-want-to-do-better/" style="color: #0000FF">staff editorial </a> addressing the ways in which our coverage has failed students of color. Specifically, we sought to highlight how both our staff and the journalism we produce has not been fully representative of the Columbia and Barnard student body, and how without this representation, we cannot adequately and comprehensively report on the communities we serve. As such, we laid out a commitment to not only improving our coverage but to building a more diverse staff, in everything from how we recruit, train, and support our members.
    <br></br>
    </p>
    <p>
            As part of this commitment to growing staff diversity, we conducted an anonymous internal diversity survey to better understand who makes up our staff, the findings of which are summarized below. Of the 302 people on staff at the time the survey was sent out, 222 staffers (74%) completed it. Though this does not account for everyone, we believe the survey’s findings are representative of our current staff. 
        <br></br>
    </p>
    <p>
            We compared the results of our survey to publicly available enrollment data as reported in the Class of 2022 profiles for <a href = "https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/classprofile/2022" style="color: #0000FF">Columbia</a> and <a href = "https://admissions.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/class_of_2022_profile_-_final.pdf" style="color: #0000FF">Barnard</a>. Of note, Columbia’s profile only includes Columbia College and Engineering students and does not account for General Studies students. We acknowledge that this means our analysis does not always make comparisons that apply to Columbia’s entire undergraduate population, a challenge that is further exacerbated by Spectator’s lack of GS students on our own staff.
            <br></br>
    </p>
    <p>
            Where applicable, we also broke down the results of the survey across two subsets of our staff: between leadership and non-leadership, and between our Journalism division and Business & Innovations division. Our leadership consists of those who hold managerial positions, which includes members of our Corporate, Managing, and Deputy Boards and accounts for 55 staffers (18%). The remainder of our staff are associates and trainees, accounting for 247 staffers (82%). Our Journalism division produces our written and visual reporting content, while our B&I division generates our revenue, creates our digital products, and hosts and markets our public events. Journalism is made up of 218 staffers (73%) and B&I is made up of 80 staffers (27%).

        Our staff comes from 32 U.S. states, with California, New York, New Jersey, and Texas being the four most represented. Columbia reports having students from all 50 states, while Barnard reports having students from 40. At both schools, New York, New Jersey, California, and Texas are also among the top 10 most represented states.

 <p>At all levels, our staff is primarily made up of undergraduates from Columbia College and Barnard, and our population of SEAS students is predominantly accounted for in B&I. We have a disproportionately low number of undergraduates from the School of General Studies, reflected in the fact that we have no GS students in leadership.

    <p>Our staff is predominantly women, who make up 75% of our staff, while men account for 22% and nonbinary individuals account for 2%. The breakdown between men and women remains fairly consistent among leadership and non-leadership, though the percentage of men is higher in B&I and lower in Journalism. Nonbinary staffers are not represented in B&I or in leadership. 
       <br></br>
        </p>
    <p>
            When Columbia’s undergraduate student body is adjusted to include Barnard’s majority female student body, the total population is approximately 66% female, meaning our representation of women is above that of the combined undergraduate schools.

        The goal of this survey, the first of its kind at Spectator, was to understand who comprises our staff, so that we can become a more diverse and inclusive office.
        <br></br>
</p>
<p><b>Recruitment:</b> Spectator is committed to recruiting more students currently underrepresented at Spectator, especially those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, namely students who are black and Hispanic/Latinx, and those from the School of General Studies. As part of this commitment, we will use more accessible recruitment practices that lower the barrier of entry to Spectator. For instance, our Product team requires no prior coding experience and our Design team does not require the submission of an art portfolio. Similarly, we have purchased a staff camera so that joining our Photo team does not require ownership of camera equipment.
        <br></br>
</p>
</p>
<p><b>Work-Study:</b> Additionally, we hope to provide more transparent details regarding the process of seeking employment through our work-study program, both for our staff and for <a href = "http://www.specpublishing.com/work-study-faqs" style="color: #0000FF" >applicants to Spectator</a> (work-study is not a factor when being considered for a role at Spectator). Additionally, expanding opportunities for low-income students to work at Spectator is a priority of ours, and as such. work-study is our top fundraising priority for 2019. We continually seek financial support from alumni and other parties interested in funding the increasing socioeconomic diversity of our staff and hope that one day Spectator will be able to cover the full work-study need of its staff.
        <br></br>
</p>

    <p><b>Inaugural committee on Diversity & Inclusion: </b> In spring of 2019, Spectator formed an inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Committee to create a dedicated space for conversation around issues of diversity and inclusion and action around improving both. This committee, which is currently comprised of four leadership members across both the Journalism and B&I divisions of the company, has undertaken a number of efforts to increase visibility for issues of diversity and inclusion at Spectator since its inception. Moving forward, the committee will continue to foster transparent and honest conversation internally, ensuring that we are constantly reevaluating and strengthening our day-to-day reporting and business practices, and plans to facilitate more avenues through which the external community can more directly engage with us.
</p>

<br>
        <ul class = a>
                <li><b>Listening Sessions:</b> the committee holds listening sessions with each of Spectator’s 13 sections to garner input from staffers about the state of diversity and inclusion at Spectator, both in our workplace and in the content and products we produce. Staffers are invited to share the ways in which diversity and inclusion specifically impacts their experience at Spectator as well as the work they do. These conversations often include brainstorming sessions with regards to how Spectator can best improve how it operates. 
                    </li> <br>
                <li><b>Collecting Data:</b> the inaugural committee led the effort to create this staff diversity survey to better understand who comprises the staff of Spectator.

            <li>Data collected is from March 2019 and includes Spring 2019 recruits. 
                </li> <br>
            <li>Staff members on temporary leave were included in data analysis for consistency purposes.

            <li>Questions that rely on survey results may be slightly skewed, depending on the response rate. Response rates are indicated per nominal variable.

                        The survey was completed voluntarily and data does not represent the entire organization, but the majority of it: 222 responses were recorded in total, a 74% completion rate. Response rate is above 200 per question. 90% of respondents answered each question, barring domestic diversity (which may be attributed to students outside of the U.S).

                        Data is based on self-reported identification, with the exception of work-study data, which is sourced from Spectator’s internal records instead of survey responses in order to accurately represent the composition of the entire organization.

                        Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.
